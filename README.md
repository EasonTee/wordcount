This is a web application that counts words on a website. 
ref: https://realpython.com/flask-by-example-part-1-project-setup/
I follow the tutorial, anyway i changed some of the codes as this tutorial was created many years ago, some codes need to be updated.

1) Part One: Set up a local development environment and then deploy both a staging and a production environment on Heroku. (completed)

2) Part Two: Set up a PostgreSQL database along with SQLAlchemy and Alembic to handle migrations. (completed)

3) Part Three: Add in the back-end logic to scrape and then process the word counts from a webpage using the requests, BeautifulSoup, and Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) libraries. (completed)

4) Part Four: Implement a Redis task queue to handle the text processing. (not compatible with window os)
Possible solution: switch to linux os and continue to build from there
